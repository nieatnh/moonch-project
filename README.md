# MOONCH

Moonch is a VR educative application for smarth phones and a 3D version for tablets, the game will allow our children to locate the moon and others planetary bodies, any time of day, even below horizon.
Once they find the moon with the app help, they start a fun trip to the moon surface in their space ship, during the trip, they will have to collect cards with important information about the moon (stories, fun facts, current lunar data, images and videos), this cards are fuel for their space ship in the challenge to conquer the moon.
When they reach the moon the game will create a virtual reallity environment where they can explore the moon and check all the information they have collected the way there as a personal gallery, this information can be shared with friends on social networks, this way we increase awareness about space missions among our children.
The children will use this technology to learn in a fun way.
